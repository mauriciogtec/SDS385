---------------------------

My solutions are in html, created with RMarkdown (even if there's no R formulas, RMarkdown comes preconfigured with all the necessary MathJax and CSS stuff necessary, so it's cool...).

Unfortuntaley, Github is not as friendly with Rmd as it is with Jupyter notebooks, say..., so I created a Github Page at
[mauriciogtec.github.io/SDS385](https://mauriciogtec.github.io/SDS385), so that you can see the pretty html version. Below are also **direct links**:
