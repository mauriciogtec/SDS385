# SDS385: Stats Models for Big Data 

About this repository...

This my personal page for SDS 385. Here I will share my solutions to exercises as well as discussions that I find important. I am super happy to receive feedback, and even better, pull requests!.

Cheers

---------------------------

My solutions are in html, created with RMarkdown (even if there's no R formulas, RMarkdown comes preconfigured with all the necessary MathJax and CSS stuff necessary, so it's cool...).

Unfortuntaley, Github is not as friendly with Rmd as it is with Jupyter notebooks, say..., so I created a Github Page at
[mauriciogtec.github.io/SDS385](https://mauriciogtec.github.io/SDS385), so that you can see the pretty html version. Below are also **direct links**:

* `Solution04`: 
    + [`readsvm`](https://github.com/SDS385team/readsvm/blob/master/src/read_svm.cpp) The R/Rcpp package I created for reading SVM light data. You can install this package on any machine using the command `devtools::install_github("SDS385team/readsvm")`.
    + [`sparselogit`](https://github.com/SDS385team/sparselogit/blob/master/src/sparselogit.cpp) The R/Rcpp package I created to perform logistic regression on big sparse data set with lazy updating and stochastic gradient descent. You can install this package on any machine using the command `devtools::install_github("SDS385team/sparselogit")`
    + [`vignette`](https://github.com/mauriciogtec/SDS385/tree/master/Exercises/Solutions04/Solution04-SDS385.html) A brief report of the results using sparselogit on the SPAM dataset.
